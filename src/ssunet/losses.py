    This function calculates a loss similar to cross-entropy, but adapted for photon-count data.
    It's designed to measure the discrepancy between the predicted photon distribution (result)

    The loss is computed as follows:
    1. If a mask is provided, both result and target are multiplied by the mask.
    2. The result is exponentiated (exp_energy = exp(result)).
    3. The negative mean of element-wise multiplication of result and target is calculated.
    4. The log of the mean of exp_energy is added, weighted by the mean of the target.

    This formulation is similar to cross-entropy in that it involves log-probabilities (result)
    and true probabilities (target), but it's adapted to handle the specific characteristics
    of photon distributions.
